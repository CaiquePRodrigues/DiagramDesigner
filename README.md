# DiagramDesigner
Diagram Designer application source

## Introduction
The Diagram Designer project was started in 2003 because I needed a tool to make diagrams for my masters thesis which
I was workin on at that time, and I didn't like any of the free tools I could find. Since then I've added a lot more 
features, but now I don't really have time to maintain it any more so I decided to release it as open source.

The source is written in Delphi 7.
